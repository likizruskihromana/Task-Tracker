# Task-Tracker
Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks.

# Requirements
The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to:

  - Add, Update, and Delete tasks
  - Mark a task as in progress or done
  - List all tasks
  - List all tasks that are done
  - List all tasks that are not done
  - List all tasks that are in progress
# Task Properties

Each task should have the following properties:
  - id: A unique identifier for the task
  - description: A short description of the task
  - status: The status of the task (todo, in-progress, done)
  - createdAt: The date and time when the task was created
  - updatedAt: The date and time when the task was last updated
  - Make sure to add these properties to the JSON file when adding a new task and update them when updating a task.
